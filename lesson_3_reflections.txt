When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when sharing the projects with other people who can add to it and share their contributions in turn.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? to make sure that only the desired commits are sync'd locally.
